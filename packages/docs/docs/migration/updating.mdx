# Update Guide

The latest patch notes can be found
[here](https://github.com/canvas-commons/canvas-commons/releases).

To update all the `@canvas-commons` packages to the latest version use the
following:

```bash
npm update --save @canvas-commons/2d @canvas-commons/core @canvas-commons/ui @canvas-commons/vite-plugin
```

## Troubleshooting

If you get any errors, try removing `package-lock.json` and the `node_modules`
folder, then run `npm install` again.
